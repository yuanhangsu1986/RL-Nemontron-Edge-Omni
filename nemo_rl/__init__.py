This is a work around to ensure whenever NeMo RL is imported, that we
add Megatron-LM to the python path. This is because the only sub-package
that's officially installed is megatron.core. So we add the whole repo into
the path so we can access megatron.{training,legacy,inference,...}

Since users may pip install NeMo RL, this is a convenience so they do not
have to manually run with PYTHONPATH=3rdparty/Megatron-LM-workspace/Megatron-LM.
